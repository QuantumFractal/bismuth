fun with procgen.

This repo is meant to explore my musings with randomly generated systems. I've mainly spent all of my time implementing a kdTree and nearest neighbor search because collision detection is important for physically based systems (like algae, roots, etc). 

## UPDATE

Putting some dope SVG to GCODE motion planning stuff here.

### TODO

- [x] Write initial SVG Parser
- [ ] Write sub parser for PATH tag
- [ ] Write sub parser for POLYGON and POLYLINE tag
- [ ] Write attribute / tag filter



## Roots
